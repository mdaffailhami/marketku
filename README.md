# MarketKu

MarketKu is an e-commerce application that I created using the Flutter framework and Firebase technology. It is designed to provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for customers who want to buy products and services online. With its user-friendly interface and advanced features, MarketKu is an excellent platform for people who want to sell their goods and services online.

The main goal behind creating MarketKu was to participate in the iTech Poliban Competition 2022. After putting in a lot of hard work and dedication, I am proud to say that I won the first prize in the competition. The application provides a platform for people to offer their services, such as beauty treatments, home cleaning, car rental, etc.

One of the key features of MarketKu is its integration with Firebase technology. Firebase provides database, cloud storage, and efficient backend development, enabling MarketKu to function smoothly and efficiently. This integration ensures that customers have a seamless shopping experience and that businesses can manage their online stores easily and efficiently.

Overall, MarketKu is a comprehensive and innovative e-commerce application that provides a seamless shopping experience for its users. It is designed to cater to the needs of modern-day shoppers and businesses and is an excellent solution for those who want to buy and sell products and services online.
